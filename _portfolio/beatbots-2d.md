    excerpt: "BeatBots 2D puts Keepon, your favorite dancing robot, on your flatscreenÂ devices! Interact with this squishy animated Keepon through touch (it looks around at your pokes; leans and turns with your swipes; and compresses with your pinches); movement (it uses the accelerometer in your device to lean and bounce as it tilts and shakes); and music (it hears the beats in music, snapping, or clapping through your device's microphone and dances in time with the rhythm)."
