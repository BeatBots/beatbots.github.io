    excerpt: "Metrognōm, designed in collaboration with Justine Kasznica, is a metro-gnome and a functional metronome, envisioned as a teaching tool for young musicians who need a little encouragement to practice their instruments. Metrognōm would include an online interactive feature, allowing music students, teachers, and parents to schedule practice times and track performance while making music education fun!"
